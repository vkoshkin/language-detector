User danielnaber has made available a profile for Esperanto on his website, see open tasks.

There are two kinds of profiles. The standard ones created from Wikipedia articles and similar.
And the "short text" profiles created from Twitter tweets. Fewer language profiles exist for the
short text, more would be available, see https://github.com/optimaize/language-detector/issues/57

### Other Languages

You can create a language profile for your own language easily.
See https://github.com/optimaize/language-detector/blob/master/src/main/resources/README.md


## How it Works

The software uses language profiles which were created based on common text for each language.
N-grams http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram were then extracted from that text, and that's what is stored in the profiles.

When trying to figure out in what language a certain text is written, the program goes through the same process:
It creates the same kind of n-grams of the input text. Then it compares the relative frequency of them, and finds the
language that matches best.


### Challenges

This software does not work as well when the input text to analyze is short, or unclean. For example tweets.

When a text is written in multiple languages, the default algorithm of this software is not appropriate.
You can try to split the text (by sentence or paragraph) and detect the individual parts. Running the language guesser
on the whole text will just tell you the language that is most dominant, in the best case.

This software cannot handle it well when the input text is in none of the expected (and supported) languages.
For example if you only load the language profiles from English and German, but the text is written in French,
the program may pick the more likely one, or say it doesn't know. (An improvement would be to clearly detect that
it's unlikely one of the supported languages.)

If you are looking for a language detector / language guesser library in Java, this seems to be the best open source
library you can get at this time. If it doesn't need to be Java, you may want to take a look at https://code.google.com/p/cld2/


## How to Use

#### Language Detection for your Text

    //load all languages:
    List<LanguageProfile> languageProfiles = new LanguageProfileReader().readAllBuiltIn();

    //build language detector:
    LanguageDetector languageDetector = LanguageDetectorBuilder.create(NgramExtractors.standard())
            .withProfiles(languageProfiles)
            .build();

    //create a text object factory
    TextObjectFactory textObjectFactory = CommonTextObjectFactories.forDetectingOnLargeText();

    //query:
    TextObject textObject = textObjectFactory.forText("my text");
    Optional<LdLocale> lang = languageDetector.detect(textObject);


#### Creating Language Profiles for your Training Text

See https://github.com/optimaize/language-detector/wiki/Creating-Language-Profiles


## How You Can Help

If your language is not supported yet, then you can provide clean "training text", that is, common text written in your
language. The text should be fairly long (a couple of pages at the very least). If you can provide that, please open
a ticket.

If your language is supported already, but not identified clearly all the time, you can still provide such training
text. We might then be able to improve detection for your language.

If you're a programmer, dig in the source and see what you can improve. Check the open tasks.


## Memory Consumption

Loading all 71 language profiles uses 74MB ram to store the data in memory.
